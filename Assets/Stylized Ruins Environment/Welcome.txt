Thank you for purchasing the Stylized Ruins Environments Pack!

You can immediately start with creating your first environment. 
Open the Prefabs folder, take a look at the variety of assets and start constructing your scene.
Multiple demoscene are included aswell.


If you like the package we would greatly appreciate a small review on the product page! :)
I hope you'll have fun creating interesting and beautiful scenes!



Some tips:
Use the Post Processing Stack for better visuals (Availabe for free as a Unity Plugin)

In order to use the foliage that is included, you must first create a Terrain, then add the textures in the 'Paint Details' tab and paint the grass/flowers across the terrain. (There are also plenty of tutorials online explaining this)

In order to change the color of your bushes/trees, simply click on the 'M_leaf' Material and adjust the Color on the Albedo section. (Same goes for any material)
